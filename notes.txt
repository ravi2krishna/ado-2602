    -> Azure Cloud 

    -> DevOps Tools 

    -> Azure DevOps 


-> Azure Cloud 

    -> On Cloud We Host Applications 

        -> https://www.myntra.com/

    -> Any Application has Data 

        -> WRT Myntra we have products, prices, quantity, images etc 
    
    -> Where is this Data stored ? 

        -> Data is in Servers 

    -> What is a Server ?

        -> A Server is a computer system, that takes a Request and Sends Response 

            -> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Client-server-model.svg/1280px-Client-server-model.svg.png

    -> Where is this Server stored ? 

        -> Servers are Hosted / Located inside a "Datacenter" 

    -> Data Center 

        -> A Data Center is a building, a dedicated space within the building or 
        a group of buildings, used to house computer systems and associated components
        such as telecommunication and storage systems.

    -> Cons Of Managing Physical Datacenter

        -> Buy Physical Place 
        -> Buying Devices [CPU, RAM, HDD, Routers etc]
        -> Buy AC's, Humidifiers, Cables etc 
        -> Hire Human Resources [Physical Security, System Admins, Network Admins etc]
        -> etc 

    -> To Overcome Above Issues, we can opt for Cloud Computing 

    -> Cloud Computing

        -> The Cloud refers to "On-Demand" availability of Compute Power, 
        Database Storage, Applications and Other IT Resources through a 
        Cloud Platform(Azure, AWS, GCP, OCI etc) via "Internet" with
        "Pay As You Go" Pricing.

        -> Cloud Computing can be compared to Online Ride Services 

            -> Ola, Uber, Rapido etc 

            -> Bike, Car, On-demand, Schedule etc  

        -> Cloud Has Vendors 

            -> Azure, AWS, GCP etc 

            -> Cloud Vendors Provide Services like IAAS, PAAS & SAAS.

            -> Using IAAS + PAAS + SAAS also We can build

    
    -> Cloud Types / Models 

        -> Public Cloud 

            -> Public cloud resources are shared with multiple tenants. 

        -> Private Cloud 

            -> Private means services are offered to selected entity only i.e One tenant

        -> Hybrid Cloud 

            -> Hybrid cloud is a mix of private and public cloud.

    
    -> Azure Cloud Goal is to host Applications On Cloud 

    -> Traditional Approach (Setting Up Applications On Physical Datacenter)

        -> Myntra Application 

            -> Servers 
                +
            -> Storage

            -> Security 
                +
            -> etc 

    -> New Approach (Setting Up Applications On Cloud Datacenter - On Azure)

        -> Myntra Application 

            -> Servers      - Azure Virtual Machines Service   
                +                   +
            -> Storage      - Azure Disk, Storage Accounts, FileShares Services
                +                   +
            -> Databases    - Azure SQL Service                                     ========>   Application 
                +                   +
            -> Networking   - Azure Virtual Network Service
                +                   +
            -> Security     - Azure Entra ID Service
                +                   +
            -> etc          - Other Azure Services 

    
    -> Once Application is built on Cloud 

        -> Application should have following characteristics (Four Pillars Of Cloud)

            -> High Availability

                -> High Availability in Azure ensures Applications are continuously 
                Accessible & Operational (24X7) i.e Uptime 99.9% and Above 

            -> Fault Tolerance 

                -> Fault Tolerance in Azure is an ability of the systems to continue 
                operating without interruption in the event of Hardware Failures i.e "Self Healing" 

            -> Scalability 

                -> Scalability in Azure is an ability of the systems to handle the 
                increasing workloads and accommodate according to Growing Demands.

            -> Security 

                -> Security in Azure refers to measures taken to protect cloud Resources, Data and 
                Applications from Unauthorized Access

=============

    -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS

        -> Azure Global Infra - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/global-infrastructure/

            -> 70+ Azure regions | 400+ datacenters

            -> https://datacenters.microsoft.com/globe/explore/

        -> Azure Infrastructure is made of 

            -> Regions 

            -> Availability Zones 

        -> Regions 

            -> Azure regions are distinct, geographically dispersed locations containing at least one, 
            but often multiple, datacenters to provide global service coverage.

            -> 70+ Azure regions 

            -> Always Select Regions Based On Customers Locations(Nearest)

        -> Availability Zones 

            -> Availability Zones (AZs) are physically separate, isolated datacenters within a region, 
            featuring independent power, cooling, and networking to ensure 
            high availability and fault tolerance

            -> Availability Zones are spaced apart (often within 100km) to withstand local outages.

            -> Always Select Availability Zones for critical applications requiring high availability 
            (e.g., VMs, databases) to protect against datacenter-level failures. 

            -> https://azurelib.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-62.png

            -> For High Availability 

                -> https://blog.siliconvalve.com/static/images/2020/as03.png

        
    -> To Utilize Azure Infrastructure we need to create Azure Account 

        -> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account

            -> Email ID 
            -> Mobile Number 
            -> Card (2 INR for verification)

    
    -> Azure Virtual Networks - VNET (VPC)

        -> A Virtual Network (VNET) in Azure is a foundational service that enables you to 
        build your own private network in the Azure cloud.

        -> VNET lets you launch AZURE resources (servers, databases, storage etc) in a 
        logically isolated virtual network that you define.

        -> Having VNET is similar to having your own data center inside AZURE.

            -> https://images.ctfassets.net/xxmwcynv5jdx/3T6K8Xxgb6jk10Zio5G1gw/da9ab697929d1be9036cd1cfc56f13c8/azure-vnet.png?w=1600&h=650&q=50&fit=fill&f=center

            -> https://blog.siliconvalve.com/static/images/2020/as03.png    

    -> Azure Subnet 
    
        -> An Azure subnet is a logical division of an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) 
        that segments its address space, allowing you to organize and secure resources like 
        VMs, databases, and PaaS services within specific IP ranges for 
        better management and isolation. 
        
        -> Subnets enable fine-grained control(firewall) through Network Security Groups (NSGs) 
        for traffic filtering

        -> https://images.ctfassets.net/xxmwcynv5jdx/3T6K8Xxgb6jk10Zio5G1gw/da9ab697929d1be9036cd1cfc56f13c8/azure-vnet.png?w=1600&h=650&q=50&fit=fill&f=center

        -> NOTE: How many resources (servers) can be hosted in a subnet ? 

            -> Subnetting Rules 

                -> A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network. 

            -> Subnet Calculator

        -> Azure Network Reserved IP's 

            -> Azure reserves the first four and last IP addresses for a total of 5 IP addresses 
            within each subnet.

        -> For example, the IP address range of 10.0.1.0/24 has the following reserved addresses:

            10.0.1.0 : Network address
            10.0.1.1 : Reserved by Azure for the default gateway
            10.0.1.2, 10.0.1.3 : Reserved by Azure to map the Azure DNS
            10.0.1.255 : Network broadcast address.

                -> The addresses we can use are from only 10.0.1.4 - 10.0.1.254

        10.0.0.0/16 -> 65636

            10.0.0.0
