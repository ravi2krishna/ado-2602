-> Azure Cloud 

    -> On Cloud We Host Applications 

        -> https://www.myntra.com/

    -> Any Application has Data 

        -> WRT Myntra we have products, prices, quantity, images etc 
    
    -> Where is this Data stored ? 

        -> Data is in Servers 

    -> What is a Server ?

        -> A Server is a computer system, that takes a Request and Sends Response 

            -> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Client-server-model.svg/1280px-Client-server-model.svg.png

    -> Where is this Server stored ? 

        -> Servers are Hosted / Located inside a "Datacenter" 

    -> Data Center 

        -> A Data Center is a building, a dedicated space within the building or 
        a group of buildings, used to house computer systems and associated components
        such as telecommunication and storage systems.

            -> https://datacenters.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/OMB-Datacenter-11_11-Hero.jpg

    -> Cons Of Managing Physical Datacenter

        -> Buy Physical Place 
        -> Buying Devices [CPU, RAM, HDD, Routers etc]
        -> Buy AC's, Humidifiers, Cables etc 
        -> Hire Human Resources [Physical Security, System Admins, Network Admins etc]
        -> etc 

    -> To Overcome Above Issues, we can opt for Cloud Computing 

    -> Cloud Computing

        -> The Cloud refers to "On-Demand" availability of Compute Power, 
        Database Storage, Applications and Other IT Resources through a 
        Cloud Platform(Azure, AWS, GCP, OCI etc) via "Internet" with
        "Pay As You Go" Pricing.

        -> Cloud Computing can be compared to Online Ride Services 

            -> Ola, Uber, Rapido etc 

            -> Bike, Car, On-demand, Schedule etc  

        -> Cloud Has Vendors

    -> Cloud Types / Models 

        -> Public Cloud 

            -> Public cloud resources are shared with multiple tenants. 

        -> Private Cloud 

            -> Private means services are offered to selected entity only i.e One tenant

        -> Hybrid Cloud 

            -> Hybrid cloud is a mix of private and public cloud.

    
    -> Azure Cloud Goal is to host Applications On Cloud 

    -> Traditional Approach (Setting Up Applications On Physical Datacenter)

    -> Once Application is built on Cloud 

        -> Application should have following characteristics (Four Pillars Of Cloud)

            -> High Availability

                -> High Availability in Azure ensures Applications are continuously 
                Accessible & Operational (24X7) i.e Uptime 99.9% and Above 

            -> Fault Tolerance 

                -> Fault Tolerance in Azure is an ability of the systems to continue 
                operating without interruption in the event of Hardware Failures i.e "Self Healing" 

            -> Scalability 

                -> Scalability in Azure is an ability of the systems to handle the 
                increasing workloads and accommodate according to Growing Demands.

            -> Security 

                -> Security in Azure refers to measures taken to protect cloud Resources, Data and

=============

    -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS

        -> Azure Global Infra - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/global-infrastructure/

            -> 70+ Azure regions | 400+ datacenters

            -> https://datacenters.microsoft.com/globe/explore/

        -> Azure Infrastructure is made of 

            -> Regions 

            -> Availability Zones 

        -> Regions 

            -> Azure regions are distinct, geographically dispersed locations containing at least one, 
            but often multiple, datacenters to provide global service coverage.

            -> 70+ Azure regions 

            -> Always Select Regions Based On Customers Locations(Nearest)

        -> Availability Zones 

            -> Availability Zones (AZs) are physically separate, isolated datacenters within a region, 
            featuring independent power, cooling, and networking to ensure 
            high availability and fault tolerance

            -> Availability Zones are spaced apart (often within 100km) to withstand local outages.

            -> Always Select Availability Zones for critical applications requiring high availability 
            (e.g., VMs, databases) to protect against datacenter-level failures. 

            -> https://azurelib.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-62.png

            -> For High Availability 

                -> https://blog.siliconvalve.com/static/images/2020/as03.png

        
    -> To Utilize Azure Infrastructure we need to create Azure Account 

        -> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account

            -> Email ID 
            -> Mobile Number 
            -> Card (2 INR for verification)

    
    -> Azure Virtual Networks - VNET (VPC)

        -> A Virtual Network (VNET) in Azure is a foundational service that enables you to 
        build your own private network in the Azure cloud.

        -> VNET lets you launch AZURE resources (servers, databases, storage etc) in a 
        logically isolated virtual network that you define.

        -> Having VNET is similar to having your own data center inside AZURE.

            -> https://images.ctfassets.net/xxmwcynv5jdx/3T6K8Xxgb6jk10Zio5G1gw/da9ab697929d1be9036cd1cfc56f13c8/azure-vnet.png?w=1600&h=650&q=50&fit=fill&f=center

            -> https://blog.siliconvalve.com/static/images/2020/as03.png    

    -> Azure Subnet 
    
        -> An Azure subnet is a logical division of an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) 
        that segments its address space, allowing you to organize and secure resources like 
        VMs, databases, and PaaS services within specific IP ranges for 
        better management and isolation. 
        
        -> Subnets enable fine-grained control(firewall) through Network Security Groups (NSGs) 
        for traffic filtering

        -> https://images.ctfassets.net/xxmwcynv5jdx/3T6K8Xxgb6jk10Zio5G1gw/da9ab697929d1be9036cd1cfc56f13c8/azure-vnet.png?w=1600&h=650&q=50&fit=fill&f=center

        -> NOTE: How many resources (servers) can be hosted in a subnet ? 

            -> Subnetting Rules 

                -> A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network.

        -> Azure Network Reserved IP's 

            -> Azure reserves the first four and last IP addresses for a total of 5 IP addresses 
            within each subnet.

        -> For example, the IP address range of 10.0.1.0/24 has the following reserved addresses:

            10.0.1.0 : Network address
            10.0.1.1 : Reserved by Azure for the default gateway
            10.0.1.2, 10.0.1.3 : Reserved by Azure to map the Azure DNS
            10.0.1.255 : Network broadcast address.

                -> The addresses we can use are from only 10.0.1.4 - 10.0.1.254

        10.0.0.0/16 -> 65636

            10.0.0.0

=============

    -> Route Tables 

        -> An Azure Route Table is a resource that controls network traffic flow 
        within an Azure Virtual Network (VNet)

        -> You associate a route table with subnets, directing traffic based on destination
        (IP address range) and next hop(Internet, Gateway etc) 

        -> Create a route table when you need to override Azure’s default routing. 
        For example, you can route traffic to a network virtual appliance or to your 
        on-premises network for inspection. 
        A route table contains routes and is associated to one or more subjects.

    -> Considering Our VNET 

        -> We Want Two Types Of Traffic Flow 

            -> Public: Which should be Accessible From Internet 

                -> Web & Application Subnets

            -> Private: Which should not be Accessible From Internet 

                -> Database Subnet 

    -> Network Security Groups - NSG (Firewalls)

        -> Azure network security group is used to "filter" network traffic to and from 
        Azure resources in an Azure virtual network.

        -> A network security group contains "security rules" that "allow" or "deny" 
        inbound network traffic.

        -> For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.

        -> Based On Application Requirements we define rules in NSG 

            -> Myntra Web NSG 

                -> SSH Access (Admin Access For Linux Server) - Port 22 
                -> HTTP Access (For Web Applications) - Port 80 
                -> HTTPS Access (For Web Applications Secured) - Port 443 

            -> Myntra App NSG 

                -> SSH Access (Admin Access For Linux Server) - Port 22 
                -> HTTP Access (For Backends / API) - Port 8080 (8000 - 3000 - 5000 etc)

            -> Myntra DB NSG 

                -> SSH Access (Admin Access For Linux Server) - Port 22 
                -> MySQL DB Access - Port 3306 

            -> NOTE: If using Windows Server, add RDP Access (Admin Access For Windows Server) 
            - Port 3389 


        -> Azure Public IP's 

            -> Public IP addresses allow Internet resources to communicate inbound to 
            Azure resources. Public IP addresses enable Azure resources to communicate to 
            Internet and public-facing Azure services.

            -> For Myntra Web Server & App Server we need an Public IP's as they are 
            internet facing entities.

        -> Azure Private IP's 

            -> Private IP addresses allow Azure resources to communicate within Vnet i.e
            Intranet or local network

            -> NOTE: Every Server will have private ip as primary address and optionally   
            we can add public ip for Internet access

    -> Azure Network Interfaces - NIC 

        -> In Azure, a Network Interface (NIC) is a crucial resource that connects a 
        Virtual Machine (VM) to a Virtual Network (VNet), enabling communication 
        with the internet, other Azure services, and on-premises networks. 
        Each NIC acts as a virtual network adapter, allowing for IP configurations 
        (private/public, static/dynamic), association with Network Security Groups (NSGs) 
        for traffic filtering, and even multiple NICs per VM for advanced connectivity.

        -> NOTE: Azure By default creates Network Interface, when we create Virtual Machine and 
        we cannot attach Custom Network Interface, so we stop server and detach default Network Interface
        and later attach our Custom Network Interface, this is must in GUI   

        -> NOTE: If we Use CLI we can overcome above, while creating Virtual Machine in CLI
        we can attach our custom Network Interface directly

    -> Testing Myntra VNET 

        -> Public Server i.e Web Server 

        -> Private Server i.e Database Server 

    -> To Create Servers we have Virtual Machines Service From Azure 

    -> After Virtual Machine is created, update network settings like Network Interfaces
    and NSG 

    -> Testing Myntra Web Server & Myntra DB Server connectivity using 

        -> Terminal / Powershell / GitBash 

        -> https://ssheasy.com/ 

    -> NOTE: Myntra Web Server Accessible From Internet & Myntra DB Server Not Accessible From Internet


    -> Most Popular Applications
            
            -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites

    
    -> One of the new Requirements, given by an organization (Edify)

    -> For their business needs, Edify started running an training institute 
    and wants to provide an Learning Management Systems(LMS) to their Customers 
    i.e Students, Trainers etc 

        -> Edify Requirement 

            -> Edify is going to setup the LMS App environment i.e servers on AZURE 

            -> We have three Different Tiers (Frontend - Backend - Database)

            -> Frontend - 1000 Servers 
            -> Backend - 500 Servers 
            -> Database - 200 Servers 

            -> In the future, they might add more number of subnets i.e 
            cache subnets, load balancer subnet etc

            -> The web servers and app servers needs to be communicated from internet

	        -> The database servers needs to be communicated only from App Servers, 
            but not from internet

            -> Coming to security of Web Servers, they should have only 
                -> SSH traffic enabled for administration from internet
                -> HTTP traffic for clients from internet
                -> HTTPS traffic for clients from internet

            -> Coming to security of App Servers, they should have only 
                -> SSH traffic enabled for administration from internet
                -> HTTP traffic port 3000 for clients from internet

            -> Coming to security of Database Servers, they should have only SSH access from app servers
                -> SSH traffic enabled from web servers only
                -> Postgres Database Traffic (5432) Allowed from App Servers


    -> NOTE: Earlier when we have setup Myntra Infrastructure using GUI almost took 60 Mins 

        -> Create Myntra VNET (Frontend, Backend, Database) - Using GUI - 60 Mins 

        -> New Requirement: Create LMS VNET (Frontend, Backend, Database) - Using GUI - 60 Mins 

        -> New Requirement: Create HRMS VNET (Frontend, Backend, Database) - Using GUI - 60 Mins 

        -> New Requirement: Create CRM VNET (Frontend, Backend, Database) - Using GUI - 60 Mins 

    -> NOTE: You can go with above Approach i.e GUI if you are a beginner

    -> NOTE: Once you have understanding of Infrastructure in GUI, we can use other 
    Approaches to create infrastructure in an efficient way 

    -> To Setup Infrastructure On Azure we can use

        -> Graphical User Interface - GUI - Beginner Level - No Automation - Newbies  

        -> Command Line Interface - CLI - Intermediate Level - Partial Automation - Admins 

        -> Scripting - CODE - Pro Level - Complete Automation - DevOps Engineers 


    -> Azure CLI (Command Line Interface)

        -> The Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a cross-platform "command-line tool" 
        used to create and manage Azure resources "efficiently", with an emphasis on 
        "automation" and "scripting". 

        -> Azure resources

            -> Vnet, Subnets, RouteTables, NSG, Public IP, Network Interfaces, VM, Disk etc 
    
        -> It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

        -> Install Azure CLI Using 

            -> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest

            -> Open Powershell / Terminal / Command Prompt

                -> type "az" command  

        -> To Authenticate Use 

            -> az login --use-device-code

    -> Creating Infrastructure
    
        -> GUI: Beginners 

        -> CLI: Intermediate 

        -> Code: Professional (DevOps)

    -> Infrastructure As Code - IaC (Pro/Expert)

        -> Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer 
        data center resources(vnet, subnet, nsg, pip etc) through machine-readable 
        definition files(CODE/SCRIPT), rather than physical hardware configuration(GUI) or 
        interactive configuration tools(Azure CLI).

        -> IaC Concept 

            -> The IaC model approaches networks, servers, databases, and other resources 
            in a descriptive manner via "versioning" (similar to using VCS in Development, 
            in DevOps we are tracking infrastructure code). 

                -> Like Developers write "Application Code" to Build Applications

                    -> Technologies - Java, Python, Node etc
                
                -> As DevOps Engineers, will be writing "Infrastructure Code/Scripts" to 
                Build Infrastructure

                    -> Tools / Services - Azure ARM Templates, AWS Cloudformation Templates etc

    -> Azure ARM Templates  

        -> An Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) 
        file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your Azure project 
        using a declarative syntax. It allows you to provision, manage, and deploy 
        all the necessary resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation, 
        ensuring consistency and repeatability across different environments.

        -> Using Microsoft Website 

        -> USing Visual Studio Code (IDE) 

            -> Install Azure Resource Manager Snippets Extension

        -> Best Approach is generating templates from Azure Portal (Recommended)

            -> az deployment group create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --template-file <path-to-template>

        -> Let's Move towards Server Infrastructure 

    
    -> Azure Virtual Machines - VM's 

        -> An Azure Virtual Machine (VM) is a scalable, on-demand computing resource in the 
        Microsoft Azure cloud that emulates a physical computer, giving you control over the 
        OS and applications without managing hardware.

        -> Azure Virtual Machines - VM's - components
