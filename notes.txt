-> Azure DevOps  Course

    -> Azure Cloud 

    -> DevOps Tools 

    -> Azure DevOps 


-> Azure Cloud 

    -> On Cloud We Host Applications 

        -> https://www.myntra.com/

    -> Any Application has Data 

        -> WRT Myntra we have products, prices, quantity, images etc 
    
    -> Where is this Data stored ? 

        -> Data is in Servers 

    -> What is a Server ?

        -> A Server is a computer system, that takes a Request and Sends Response 

            -> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Client-server-model.svg/1280px-Client-server-model.svg.png

    -> Where is this Server stored ? 

        -> Servers are Hosted / Located inside a "Datacenter" 

    -> Data Center 

        -> A Data Center is a building, a dedicated space within the building or 
        a group of buildings, used to house computer systems and associated components
        such as telecommunication and storage systems.

    -> Cons Of Managing Physical Datacenter

        -> Buy Physical Place 
        -> Buying Devices [CPU, RAM, HDD, Routers etc]
        -> Buy AC's, Humidifiers, Cables etc 
        -> Hire Human Resources [Physical Security, System Admins, Network Admins etc]
        -> etc 

    -> To Overcome Above Issues, we can opt for Cloud Computing 

    -> Cloud Computing

        -> The Cloud refers to "On-Demand" availability of Compute Power, 
        Database Storage, Applications and Other IT Resources through a 
        Cloud Platform(Azure, AWS, GCP, OCI etc) via "Internet" with
        "Pay As You Go" Pricing.

        -> Cloud Computing can be compared to Online Ride Services 

            -> Ola, Uber, Rapido etc 

            -> Bike, Car, On-demand, Schedule etc  

        -> Cloud Has Vendors 

            -> Azure, AWS, GCP etc 

            -> Cloud Vendors Provide Services like IAAS, PAAS & SAAS.

    
    -> Cloud Offerings 

        -> Infrastructure As A Service - IAAS

            -> Requirement: Setup MySQL Database Server 

            -> Managed By Cloud Vendor

        -> Solution - 1

            -> Using Only IAAS We can build 

            -> We Want to Build Ecommerce Application

                -> Web Server - Virtual Machines (IAAS)
                -> App Server - Virtual Machines (IAAS)
                -> DB Server  - Virtual Machines (IAAS)

        -> Solution - 2

            -> Using IAAS + PAAS We can build 

            -> We Want to Build Ecommerce Application

                -> Web Server - Virtual Machines (IAAS)
                -> App Server - Virtual Machines (IAAS)
                -> DB Server  - SQL Server (PAAS)

        -> Solution - 3

            -> Using IAAS + PAAS + SAAS also We can build

    
    -> Cloud Types / Models 

        -> Public Cloud 

            -> Public cloud resources are shared with multiple tenants. 

        -> Private Cloud 

            -> Private means services are offered to selected entity only i.e One tenant

        -> Hybrid Cloud 

            -> Hybrid cloud is a mix of private and public cloud.

    
    -> Azure Cloud Goal is to host Applications On Cloud 

    -> Traditional Approach (Setting Up Applications On Physical Datacenter)

        -> Myntra Application 

            -> Servers 
                +
            -> Storage 
                +
            -> Databases        ========>   Application 
                +
            -> Networking 
                +
            -> Security 
                +
            -> etc 

    -> New Approach (Setting Up Applications On Cloud Datacenter - On Azure)

        -> Myntra Application 

            -> Servers      - Azure Virtual Machines Service   
                +                   +
            -> Storage      - Azure Disk, Storage Accounts, FileShares Services
                +                   +
            -> Databases    - Azure SQL Service                                     ========>   Application 
                +                   +
            -> Networking   - Azure Virtual Network Service
                +                   +
            -> Security     - Azure Entra ID Service
                +                   +
            -> etc          - Other Azure Services 

    
    -> Once Application is built on Cloud 

        -> Application should have following characteristics (Four Pillars Of Cloud)

            -> High Availability

                -> High Availability in Azure ensures Applications are continuously 
                Accessible & Operational (24X7) i.e Uptime 99.9% and Above 

            -> Fault Tolerance 

                -> Fault Tolerance in Azure is an ability of the systems to continue 
                operating without interruption in the event of Hardware Failures i.e "Self Healing" 

            -> Scalability 

                -> Scalability in Azure is an ability of the systems to handle the 
                increasing workloads and accommodate according to Growing Demands.

            -> Security 

                -> Security in Azure refers to measures taken to protect cloud Resources, Data and 
                Applications from Unauthorized Access
